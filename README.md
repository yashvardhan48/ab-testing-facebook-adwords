*Note: Original client data anonymized.*

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Statsmodels
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## Techniques Applied
- Hypothesis testing (t-tests, p-values)
- A/B testing
- Linear regression
- Data cleaning and visualization

## Key Insights
- Determined which campaign was more cost-effective
- Identified metrics driving conversions
- Suggested actionable recommendations for marketing optimization

## How to Run
1. Open `ab-testing-marketing-campaigns.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure required libraries are installed (`pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`).
3. Run each cell to see analysis, plots, and results.
